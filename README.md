# üèè T20 Cricket Chase Prediction using ANN (Flask Web App)

This project is a web-based application built using **Flask** that predicts whether a **T20 cricket chase will be successful** based on real-time match features. It uses a **trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model and a **StandardScaler** to preprocess the input.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Predicts **chase success** or **failure** in a T20 cricket match.
- Interactive web interface for input.
- Displays probability (%) of a successful chase.
- Built with **Flask**, **TensorFlow**, and **scikit-learn**.
